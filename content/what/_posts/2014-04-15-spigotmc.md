From April 2014 to October 2016, I was a community moderator and staff member of the [SpigotMC project](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/about-spigot/).

There, I handled user reports for a community forum with over 400,000 registered members.
I also replied to support emails and directly worked with users to solve problems.
I was a co-conspirator for Spigot's event planning for the annual Minecraft convention, MINECON, in [London 2015](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/in-summary-a-very-unofficial-overview-of-minecon-2015.75995/) and [Anaheim 2016](https://blog.jwf.io/2016/11/spigotmc-california-minecon/).
This is one of the most unique projects I have worked with, as the Spigot community is a population of hundreds of thousands with an age demographic concentrated between ages 13-25.
