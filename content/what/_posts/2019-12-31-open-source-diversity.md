I am a part of the [Open Source Diversity][1] community since early 2017.
I also facilitated a merge between a former D&I community led by Mozilla and the Open Source Diversity community.

The Mozilla group was formerly led by [Emma Irwin][2] and was [handed off to the community][3] in October 2019.
Since then, I volunteered to manage some community channels, and later got involved with the core Open Source Diversity team in March 2020.
I do not have an official title or role in this community, but it is a community that is important to me!
