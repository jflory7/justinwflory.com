Since 2018, I am a leading member of the [LibreCorps](https://fossrit.github.io/librecorps/) program of the [FOSS@MAGIC initiative](https://fossrit.github.io/about/) at the Rochester Institute of Technology.
Through my work with LibreCorps and UNICEF, I work as a consultant on open source projects and community-building.
RITâ€™s LibreCorps mentors build interactive resources for clients to build engaging communities around their projects.
