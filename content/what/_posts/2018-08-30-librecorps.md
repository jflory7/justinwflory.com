From August 2018 to April 2019, I was a leading member of the [LibreCorps](https://fossrit.github.io/librecorps/) program of the [FOSS@MAGIC initiative](https://fossrit.github.io/about/) at the Rochester Institute of Technology.

In recent years, RIT LibreCorps collaborated with the [Innovation Fund](https://unicefinnovationfund.org/), a pooled funding vehicle to quickly assess, fund and grow open-source solutions that have been developed in new and emerging markets.
Through my work with RIT LibreCorps and our partners like the Innovation Fund, I provide expertise and mentorship for developing sustainable communities around open source projects.
In 2019, I led multiple half-day workshops together with [Prof. Stephen Jacobs](https://www.rit.edu/directory/sxjics-stephen-jacobs) for UNICEFâ€™s [Innovation Fund](https://unicefinnovationfund.org/) to introduce over 20 international start-up teams to the Open Source way.
You can read more about this work on our Opensource.com article, [_LibreCorps mentors humanitarian startups on how to run the open source way_](https://opensource.com/article/19/12/humanitarian-startups-open-source).
