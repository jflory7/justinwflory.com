From August 2018 to April 2020, I was a leading member of the [LibreCorps][1] program of the [FOSS@MAGIC initiative][2] at the Rochester Institute of Technology.

In recent years, RIT LibreCorps collaborated with the [Innovation Fund][3], a pooled funding vehicle to quickly assess, fund and grow open-source solutions that have been developed in new and emerging markets.
Through my work with RIT LibreCorps and our partners like the Innovation Fund, I provide expertise and mentorship for developing sustainable communities around open source projects.
In 2019, I led multiple half-day workshops together with [Prof. Stephen Jacobs][4] for UNICEFâ€™s [Innovation Fund][3] to introduce over 20 international start-up teams to the Open Source way.
You can read more about this work on our Opensource.com article, [_LibreCorps mentors humanitarian startups on how to run the open source way_][5].
