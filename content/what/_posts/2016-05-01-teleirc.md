I participate as a maintainer and project manager of the [TeleIRC](https://github.com/RITlug/teleirc) project.
TeleIRC is a [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) <=> [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) bridge written in Go to bridge chat rooms between any IRC channel and Telegram group.
Read through the [progress reports](https://blog.jwf.io/tag/teleirc/) on my blog.
