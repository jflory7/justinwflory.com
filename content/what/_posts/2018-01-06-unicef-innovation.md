From January - May 2018, I was the first, full-time co-op placement to work exclusively on open source community for [UNICEF Office of Innovation](https://www.unicef.org/innovation/).
I supported [MagicBox](https://www.unicef.org/innovation/Magicbox), a geospatial data project connecting unrelated datasets into actionable feedback for local governments and municipalities.
I improved open source best practices to enable continuous integration, agile development practices, and created a 12 month open source community roadmap.
There, I worked together with UNICEF personnel and [Red Hat Open Innovations Lab](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/consulting/open-innovation-labs) on MagicBox.
This was an engagement highlighted by Jim Whitehurst, Red Hat CEO, during his Red Hat Summit 2018 keynote.
Since then, I led half-day workshops together with [Prof. Stephen Jacobs](https://www.rit.edu/directory/sxjics-stephen-jacobs) for UNICEFâ€™s [Innovation Fund](https://unicefinnovationfund.org/) to introduce over 20 international start-up teams to the Open Source way.
