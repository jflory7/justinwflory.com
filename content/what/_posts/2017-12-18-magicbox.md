From January - May 2018, I was the first, full-time co-op placement to work exclusively on open source community for [UNICEF Office of Innovation][1].

I supported [MagicBox][2], a geospatial data project connecting unrelated datasets into actionable feedback for local governments and municipalities.
I improved open source best practices to enable continuous integration, agile development practices, and created a 12 month open source community roadmap.
There, I worked together with UNICEF personnel and [Red Hat Open Innovations Lab][3] on MagicBox.
This was an engagement highlighted by Jim Whitehurst, President of IBM and former Red Hat CEO, during his Red Hat Summit 2018 keynote.
