<font face="Liberation Sans, sans-serif"><font size="6" style="font-size: 28pt"><b><i>Angels
&amp; Demons</i> Quotations</b></font></font></p>
<h1 class="western" align="center">Science v. Religion</h1>
<blockquote>“<i>Science and religion are not in this together! We
do not seek the same God, you and I! Who is your God? One of protons,
masses, and particle charges? How does your God inspire? How does
your God reach into the hearts of man and remind him he is
accountable to a greater power! Remind him that he is accountable to
his fellow man! Vetra was misguided. His work was not religious, it
was sacrilegious! Man cannot put God's Creation in a test tube and
wave it around for the world to see! This does not glorify God, it
demeans God!</i>” — <b>Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca</b></blockquote>
<p>This quote clearly connects the theme of science versus religion
to the novel, as this quote exemplifies the constant struggle between
science and religion, and how they can seldom seem to get along.
Ventresca's vicious opinion regarding science only serves as an
example of one side of the spectrum in terms of how the two sides
feel about the other, although it does not necessarily have to be
this way.</p>
<h1 class="western" align="center">Good v. Evil</h1>
<blockquote>“<i>Those who believe undergo great tests for God! God
asked Abraham to sacrifice his child! God commanded Jesus to endure
crucifixion! And so we hang the symbol of the crucifix before our
eyes - bloody, painful, agonizing to remind us of evil's power! To
keep our hearts vigilant! The scars on Jesus' body are a living
reminder of the powers of darkness! My scars are a living reminder!
Evil lives, but the power of God will overcome!</i>” — <b>Camerlengo
Carlo Ventresca</b></blockquote>
<p>This quote serves as an example of the struggle between good and
evil as Ventresca's behavior demonstrates how the church would be
perceived by the public or the majority as a positive influence in
the plot of the book, and how the church might try to resolve the
issue, when in reality, it is one of their own that has caused the
entire issue.</p>
<h1 class="western" align="center">Morality v. Sin</h1>
<blockquote>“<i>There is no risk when God is at your side. This
cause was His.</i>” — <span style="font-style: normal"><b>Camerlengo
Carlo Ventresca</b></span></blockquote>
<p>Ventresca's opposing viewpoints between his actions as serving
God's word and acts of sin are demonstrating within this quote, as
when Ventresca was questioned about his motives, he says that his
motivation was the message of God, and that he was acting on behalf
of God, while overlooking the severe level of atrocities and sin that
he had committed.</p>
<h1 class="western" align="center">Modesty v. Pride</h1>
<blockquote>“<i>But I do know that until I get some answers that
make </i><i><b>sense</b></i><i>, there is no way I will raise any
sort of alarm. Vigilance and discretion are my duty… such that
spiritual matters can take place here with clarity of mind.</i>” —
<b>Commander Olivetti</b></blockquote>
<p>Olivetti's stubborn persistence upon not acting on the issue of
the antimatter in the Vatican is part of his pretentious (and
eventually incorrect) mindset that the Swiss Guard was incorruptible,
and his pride prevented him from detecting the urgency of the
situation at hand, when action could have been taken earlier on the
issue, and possibly saving some of the executed Cardinals' lives.</p>
<h1 class="western" align="center">Public v. Private</h1>
<blockquote>“<i>We all benefit from a sense of contact with
divinity… even if it is only imagined.</i>” — <b>Camerlengo
Carlo Ventresca</b></blockquote>
<p>This final quote is an example and representation of the internal
reasoning of the church hierarchy regarding their decisions to make
public certain information relating to the antimatter crisis in the
Vatican. This quote shows Ventresca's willing to bend the minds of
the people through manipulation to convince them of a certain fact,
and this type of mindset is directly correlational to the decisions
by the Catholic Church to keep this issue a secret (that is, until
the Hassasin attracted the attention of the media to the issue).</p>
