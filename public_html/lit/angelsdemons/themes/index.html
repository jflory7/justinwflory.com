of <i>Angels &amp; Demons</i></b></font></font></p>
<h1 class="western">Science v. Religion</h1>
<p>	Science and religion is one of the most often recurring elements
of theme throughout the novel. The book's entire premise is a
constant struggle between the forces of religion with the Catholic
Church and science, with the most obvious apparition being the
antimatter threatening to destroy the city. Throughout the book,
these two forces are constantly competing, as the scientific
conspiracies of the Illuminati combat the traditional rituals and
ceremonies practiced by the Catholic Church. By the end of the novel,
we almost reach a truce between science and faith with Cardinal
Mortati's voice of reason that the spiritual world and the scientific
world can be seamlessly integrated.</p>
<h1 class="western">Good v. Evil</h1>
<p>	This theme is present in almost all aspects of the novel, as many
of the perceived institutions that would be understood to be “do
good” or make a positive impact on the world can be the cause of
evil or conspiracy. On the alternative, it also demonstrates how
seemingly ordinary or normal people can become courageous and heroic
role models when they might not have been expected to do so. We see
the struggle between good and evil constantly through the threats of
the anti-matter exploding and decimating the Vatican and all who
reside in the city. Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca is the best example of
a character most affected by this element of theme as all of his
actions are a struggle between was is perceived to be good, but is
actually a deeper, darker evil force within him.</p>
<h1 class="western">Morality v. Sin</h1>
<p>	Morality and sin are two elements of theme that are constantly
combating each other, especially within Ventresca. His internal
actions he perceives to be righteous and truly moral under the realm
of being done in the name of God and faith, when in reality, his
actions are forms of severe sin and betrayal. Ventresca is internally
convinced that his sins are righteous until the moment of vindication
for his crimes by Langdon. This theme also supports the idea that
sin, crime, and ill-doing can be deceiving and portrayed as morality
and true faith, depending on the medium of which it is conveyed. In
the instance of Ventresca, this medium was the message and purpose of
God, Christianity, and the Catholic Church, and he was blinded by his
own vision of morality that it corrupted his internal differentiation
between good will and sin.</p>
<h1 class="western">Modesty v. Pride</h1>
<p>	Modesty versus pride is a consistent battle that occurs
throughout multiple places in the book. In many cases, several
characters let their prideful character control their actions, and
they berate any form of opposition to their decisions in subconscious
fear of it damaging their reputation or pride. On the other hand, the
trait of modesty combats the prideful, irrational behavior of other
characters, and this trait is most notably championed by Langdon and
Vetra. Another example of this struggle of behavioral traits is
within Ventresca's actions, as his actions and the way he wishes to
be perceived others is influenced by his prideful and stubborn
personality, and had he exemplified a greater sense of modesty,
perhaps much of the crisis described in the novel could have been
averted.</p>
<h1 class="western">Public v. Private</h1>
<p>	The conflicting issues of public versus private is another
recurring element of theme in the novel. Throughout the course of the
book, many of the executive officials holding a significant amount of
knowledge choose to not inform the public or the face of authority,
despite the pleas of Langdon and Vetra. The Swiss Guard's decision to
not believe this knowledge and then the church hierarchy's decision
to withhold this knowledge from the public amount to a potential risk
in security and well-being of the people, as had the anti-matter
exploded, several lives could have been saved by proper course of
action and evacuation. In the end of the conflict of public versus
private, we see that public is the dominating force, especially with
Ventresca's excruciating confession and suicide in front of the
people of the Vatican.</p>
